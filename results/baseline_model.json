The previous response suggested $1 M and $2 M, but now the correct answer uses the higher limits based on the NAICS code.\n\nI also remember that Sunrise's company profile mentions they operate from a modern suite and own a vehicle for site visits, which might influence their approach to policy design. Since they're in finance, the higher limits align with their focus on risk management and long-term strategic investments.\n\nTherefore, the final recommendation should reflect the updated guidelines to ensure accuracy and compliance with their industry standards.",

They provided some info: the insured offers parcel delivery services, has 320 employees, and the annual revenue is $48 million. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the NAICS code matches what's needed for cyber coverage. From the previous conversation, there was a mention of NAICS codes related to cybersecurity. The user mentioned the NAICS code isn't known, but looking at the data from the tool response, the closest codes were 492110 (couriers) and 492210 (local messengers). Neither of these seems directly linked to cyber-related industries. \n\nAlso, the tool response showed that for small businesses, revenue and employee numbers are factors. Since the insured has 320 employees, which is well below the max of 1,500 for NAICS 492110, they fit the small business criteria. And since they offer parcel delivery, which is part of courier services, that aligns with the cyber coverage intent. \n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if there's any other NAICS code that would apply here. But based on the given data and the previous analysis, the answer seems to be yes, they are within appetite. The tool response also confirmed that the NAICS code is 492110, which supports that. So combining all these points, the conclusion is that they are within the appetite for cyber coverage.",

Also, their annual revenue is around $5.2 million, with 43 employees and $1.9 million in payroll. The building construction uses wood frames, which is important for fire resistance.\n\nNow, checking the appetite guidelines. The tool response included a list of possible NAICS codes related to woodworking, including 337110. Since the company falls into this category, it should be in appetite. Additionally, the employee count (43) and payroll ($1.9 million) both meet the small-business size and pay scale criteria set by the underwriting guidelines. Therefore, based on these factors, the company is indeed in appetite for writing policies for this product. No issues detected in the data or guidelines.

However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.",

Since the business has 740 employees, it definitely falls outside the small business category. \n\nSo, the answer should clearly state that the business does not meet the small business criteria because it has over 500 employees.

Since the company's main activity is snack production, and they have enough employees to meet the size standards, even though the tool response didn't specify the exact index, the answer should be based on the given data.

The reason is because this company provides same-day and scheduled delivery services for packages, meals, and groceries within Los Angeles County only, which constitutes a single metropolitan area. According to the NAICS classification, code 492210 \"Local Messengers and Local Delivery\" is specifically for establishments providing local delivery services within a single metropolitan area or urban center, and explicitly includes grocery delivery services and restaurant meal delivery services as illustrative examples. Since the company operates exclusively within Los Angeles County and does not operate as part of an intercity courier network, it perfectly fits the definition of NAICS code 492210.",

I needed to check that.\n\nThe user mentioned the company's main activity is same-day and scheduled package, meal, and grocery deliveries. Then, I used the `read_query` tool to fetch the appropriate NAICS code. The results showed that the correct code is 492210. \n\nLooking at the description provided, it clearly states that this industry covers local messengers and delivery services within a single metropolitan area or urban center. Given that the company operates within Los Angeles County, which is a major urban area, this aligns well with the code. Also, the example entries like grocery delivery services fit the service type described.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final answer is 492210.",

For telecommunications businesses (NAICS 517110 - the applicable small business definition category), the maximum is 1,500 employees. With 110 employees, this customer is well within the small business threshold. 3. **NAICS Code 517 Coverage:** The customer falls under NAICS code 517 (Telecommunications), which per our underwriting guidelines qualifies for higher cyber limits due to the sensitive nature of telecommunications data handling. **Recommended Coverage Limits:** - **Per-Occurrence Limit:** $3,000,000 - **Aggregate Limit:** $5,000,000 - **Deductible:** $500 These higher limits ($3M/$5M instead of the standard $1M/$2M) are specifically recommended for NAICS code 517 (Telecommunications) businesses due to the amount and type of customer data they handle, which creates elevated cyber risk exposure.",

This means the building construction codes are either Type I or Type II. Specifically, this is relevant to the following NAICS codes using the 2022 schema: 531110 Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings 531120 Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings 531130 Lessors of Miniwarehouses and Self-Storage Units 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property 721110 Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels 721120 Casino Hotels 721191 Bed-and-Breakfast Inns ***Policy Limits*** For most small business policies we recommend a per-occurence limit of $1 million and an aggregate limit of $2 million. However, for cyber liability insurance coverage: Industry, business type, amount, and type of customer data handled determine how much cyber insurance businesses need. Specifically we recommend much higher limits of $3 million per-occurence and $5 million aggregate for cyber LOB for the following NAICS classes: NAICS code 517: Telecommunications NAICS code 518: Computing Infrastructure Providers, Data Processing, Web Hosting, and Related Services NAICS code 52: Finance and Insurance NAICS code 621: Ambulatory Health Care Services NAICS code 622310: Specialty Hospitals NAICS code 623: Nursing and Residential Care Facilities NAICS code 92: Public Administration ***Policy Deductibles*** For most small business policies we recommend a deductible of $500 across LOBs. However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.",

According to the underwriting guidelines, for NAICS code 621 (which includes 621112 for Ambulatory Health Care Services), we recommend a per-occurrence limit of $3 million and an aggregate limit of $5 million for Cyber LOB. FINAL ANSWER: For a private psychiatric clinic (NAICS 621112) that primarily serves outpatients and employs M.D.s, the recommended Cyber LOB limits are $3 million per occurrence and $5 million aggregate.

They want to know the appropriate policy limit for a cyber liability insurance policy for a private psychiatric clinic based on the given company profile.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that the clinic is a private psychiatric clinic, which fits into the \"cyber\" line of business. Next, they confirmed that the practitioners are M.D.'s, which aligns with the underwriting guidelines. The clinic primarily serves outpatients, no overnight stays, which is crucial for determining the appropriate coverage limits.\n\nNow, looking at the tool responses, there's a section detailing cyber liability insurance recommendations. It specifies that for NAICS codes related to cyber services like 517 (Telecommunications) and 52 (Finance and Insurance), the per-occurrence limit should be $3 million and the aggregate $5 million. The clinic's location in Colorado and the NAICS code 621112 further support these recommendations.\n\nThe user didn't specify any particular NAICS code beyond the one they already provided, so the answer relies on standard guidelines. Since the clinic is in Colorado and uses the NAICS code 621112, applying the recommended limits makes sense. Therefore, the final recommendation would be to set the cyber liability limits to $3 million per occurrence and $5 million aggregate based on the company's classification and service type.",

Their equipment yard, office buildings, and any structures they own would benefit from property coverage. 2. **Auto Insurance** - This is in appetite (\"Yes\") for excavation contractors. Given that excavation companies typically have fleets of trucks, dump trucks, and vehicles to transport equipment, this is a critical coverage. 3. **Cyber Liability Insurance** - This is in appetite (\"Yes\") for excavation contractors. Even construction companies handle sensitive data (client information, employee records, financial data) and could face cyber risks. 4. **Business Owners Policy (BOP)** - This is in appetite (\"Yes\") for excavation contractors. A BOP bundles property and liability coverage, which could be attractive for comprehensive protection. 5. **Workers Compensation** - This shows as \"Qualified\" in our appetite guide. Since their annual revenue is $5.9M, we need to check their total annual payroll. If it's under $5M, we can offer this coverage. Excavation work involves physical labor and safety risks, making workers comp essential. **Note:** General Liability shows as \"No\" in our appetite guide for excavation contractors, so we cannot offer that as a standalone LOB.

Their payroll is under our $5M limit, and this is essential coverage for excavation work given the physical nature and safety risks involved. 2. **Property Insurance** - IN APPETITE. They likely have valuable excavation equipment, trucks, and facilities that need protection. 3. **Auto Insurance** - IN APPETITE. Excavation companies typically operate fleets including dump trucks, equipment haulers, and work vehicles. 4. **Cyber Liability Insurance** - IN APPETITE. Even construction companies face cyber risks from handling employee data, client information, and financial records. I'd recommend our standard limits of $1M per occurrence/$2M aggregate. 5. **Business Owners Policy (BOP)** - IN APPETITE. This bundles property and liability coverages for comprehensive protection. The company qualifies as a small business (under the $15M revenue threshold for NAICS 238910), so they're eligible for all in-appetite LOBs.

          "content": "Based on my analysis, I can now provide you with the appropriate policy limits recommendation for this Cyber LOB. FINAL ANSWER: For an independent diagnostic imaging center (NAICS code 621512), I recommend **higher cyber liability policy limits of $3 million per-occurrence and $5 million aggregate**. The reason is that diagnostic imaging centers fall under NAICS code 621 (Ambulatory Health Care Services), which is specifically listed in the underwriting guidelines as one of the business types that should have higher cyber liability limits due to the industry, business type, and amount of sensitive customer health data they handle. Healthcare organizations like diagnostic imaging centers process and store large amounts of protected health information (PHI), making them higher-risk targets for cyber attacks and data breaches, which justifies the increased coverage limits compared to the standard $1 million per-occurrence and $2 million aggregate limits for most small businesses.",

I checked the NAICS codes and found that diagnostic imaging centers fall under NAICS code 621512. Then, looking at the underwriting guidelines, I saw that Cyber Liability Insurance typically requires higher limits for this industry. The guidelines suggest $3 million per-occurrence and $5 million aggregate. Also, since the company is in a healthcare sector, there might be additional factors like handling PHI, which increases risk further. So, combining all these points, the answer should reflect those specific numbers. Make sure to mention both the per-occurrence and aggregate limits clearly. Alright, time to put it all together concisely.",

Based on the underwriting guidelines and the nature of their wholesale clothing distribution business, here are the additional lines of business I'd recommend presenting: **High Priority Recommendations:** 1. **Cyber Liability** - This is crucial for ApparelPlus as a wholesale distributor. They likely handle: - Customer databases and payment information - Supplier data and contracts - Online ordering systems - Electronic inventory management - Standard limits: $1M per occurrence/$2M aggregate (since they're not in the high-risk cyber categories) 2. **General Liability** - Essential coverage that complements their BOP: - Product liability for clothing defects - Customer slip-and-fall at their facilities - Coverage for their wholesale operations - Standard limits: $1M per occurrence/$2M aggregate 3. **Property** - If not already included in their BOP: - Inventory coverage (clothing stock can be substantial) - Warehouse/facility coverage - Business interruption for supply chain disruptions **Secondary Recommendations:** 4. **Workers Compensation** - Required in most states if they have employees: - Warehouse workers - Administrative staff - Exposure limits: Up to $5M annual payroll 5. **Auto** - If they have delivery vehicles or company vehicles: - Commercial auto for deliveries - Non-owned auto for employee vehicle use - Exposure limits: Up to 20 vehicles What's their current annual revenue, and do they have any delivery operations or significant employee count?",

Now I can provide you with comprehensive line of business recommendations based on their profile: **FINAL ANSWER: Here are the additional lines of business I recommend presenting to ApparelPlus:** **HIGH PRIORITY (Strongly Recommend):** 1. **Cyber Liability** - Critical for their $4.7M wholesale operation - They handle customer data, supplier information, and likely electronic transactions - Recommended limits: $1M per occurrence/$2M aggregate - Deductible: $500 2. **General Liability** - Essential complement to their BOP - Product liability for clothing defects/issues - Premises liability for their wholesale facility - Recommended limits: $1M per occurrence/$2M aggregate - Deductible: $500 3. **Workers Compensation** - Required coverage for their 32 employees - Warehouse workers, administrative staff - Since their payroll is likely well under $5M, they're in appetite - Standard coverage with state-required benefits **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Evaluate Based on Operations):** 4. **Commercial Auto** - If they have delivery vehicles or company cars - Since delivery operations are unknown, this needs clarification - If they have vehicles: up to 20 vehicles are in appetite - Recommended deductible: $1,000 5. **Property** - If not fully covered in their BOP - Additional inventory coverage beyond BOP limits - Business interruption for supply chain disruptions - Equipment coverage for specialized operations **Rationale:** ApparelPlus is in appetite for all LOBs across all states with their NAICS code 424350. Their $4.7M revenue and 32 employees make them an attractive small business client. Cyber and General Liability are particularly important given their wholesale distribution model and the value of clothing inventory they handle. Workers Comp is likely required by law in their state.

However, for cyber liability insurance coverage: Industry, business type, amount, and type of customer data handled determine how much cyber insurance businesses need. Specifically we recommend much higher limits of $3 million per-occurence and $5 million aggregate for cyber LOB for the following NAICS classes: NAICS code 517: Telecommunications NAICS code 518: Computing Infrastructure Providers, Data Processing, Web Hosting, and Related Services NAICS code 52: Finance and Insurance NAICS code 621: Ambulatory Health Care Services NAICS code 622310: Specialty Hospitals NAICS code 623: Nursing and Residential Care Facilities NAICS code 92: Public Administration ***Policy Deductibles*** For most small business policies we recommend a deductible of $500 across LOBs. However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.",

Property \u2013 covers the processing facility and equipment (standard deductible $500; recommended $1 M per-occurrence/$2 M aggregate). 2. Business Owners Policy (BOP) \u2013 bundles GL and Property into one package with streamlined pricing and administration. 3. Workers Compensation \u2013 required for your 97 employees; appetite is \u201cYes\u201d since payroll is under the $5 M threshold. 4. Auto \u2013 covers any owned, hired or non-owned vehicles (deductible $1 000; ensure they have fewer than 20 vehicles to stay in appetite). 5. Cyber Liability \u2013 appetite is \u201cYes\u201d; while seafood processors don\u2019t handle the highest-risk data, we still recommend $1 M per-occurrence/$2 M aggregate minimum (or higher if they process customer payment or supplier data). Rationale: Appetite guidelines for NAICS 311710 show \u201cYes\u201d for all of these LOBs for qualifying small businesses.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me break down what I need to do here. The user is part of a business that processes seafood, specifically focusing on general liability, and wants to expand their coverage. So far, they\u2019ve mentioned having 97 employees and that the company processes seafood. \n\nFirst, I need to confirm if the company is indeed a small business. Since their employee count is 97, which is below the typical threshold for small businesses (usually 500 employees), they qualify for the appetite guidelines provided earlier. \n\nNext, I should check the LOB categories that are in appetite based on the NAICS code. The user already mentioned General Liability, so that's covered. But they want to know which other LOBs they should consider expanding to. \n\nLooking at the previous responses, I see that after confirming the employee count, the next step was to list potential additional LOBs. The user now provides the employee count as 97, so I can directly apply that to the guidelines. \n\nI need to make sure that the suggestions align with the current business activities. The user is processing seafood, so the recommendations should cover areas like Property (for facilities), Business Owners Policy (for bundled coverage), Workers Compensation (for employee protection), Auto (vehicle coverage), and Cyber Liability (data security). \n\nAlso, the user might not have considered Cyber Liability yet, but given that they're in the seafood industry, it's worth mentioning as another area for expansion. \n\nFinally, I should present the recommendations clearly, ensuring that each point is supported by the data and guidelines, and that the answer is concise and helpful for the user to choose from.",

The company had 780 employees, which is way above that. So based on the data retrieved, the company is large enough to be classified as a large business rather than a small one. \n\nI should make sure there's no conflicting information or additional details that might affect this conclusion.

Then, after fixing, there was another issue where the code wasn't found. But now, the user provided the exact NAICS code for the TV station, which is 515120. \n\nThe user also mentioned the annual revenue was $30.5 million. Looking at the SBA size standards, NAICS 515120 has a revenue cap of $38.5 million. Since $30.5 million is within that range, the company fits the criteria.\n\nSo, putting it all together, yes, the company qualifies as a small business.

This means the building construction codes are either Type I or Type II. Specifically, this is relevant to the following NAICS codes using the 2022 schema: 531110 Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings 531120 Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings 531130 Lessors of Miniwarehouses and Self-Storage Units 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property 721110 Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels 721120 Casino Hotels 721191 Bed-and-Breakfast Inns ***Policy Limits*** For most small business policies we recommend a per-occurence limit of $1 million and an aggregate limit of $2 million. However, for cyber liability insurance coverage: Industry, business type, amount, and type of customer data handled determine how much cyber insurance businesses need. Specifically we recommend much higher limits of $3 million per-occurence and $5 million aggregate for cyber LOB for the following NAICS classes: NAICS code 517: Telecommunications NAICS code 518: Computing Infrastructure Providers, Data Processing, Web Hosting, and Related Services NAICS code 52: Finance and Insurance NAICS code 621: Ambulatory Health Care Services NAICS code 622310: Specialty Hospitals NAICS code 623: Nursing and Residential Care Facilities NAICS code 92: Public Administration ***Policy Deductibles*** For most small business policies we recommend a deductible of $500 across LOBs. However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.",

Since the construction is wood frame, it doesn't meet this requirement. Additionally, the annual revenue is below the threshold for small businesses ($7.5 million), but the construction type disqualifies it from being in appetite. Therefore, even though the revenue is reasonable, the construction type and eligibility criteria make it ineligible for the Property LOB.\n\nI should present the answer clearly, ensuring all steps are included.

A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under different tenures. For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented. It may be operated by the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated by a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, croppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm.\\n\\nThe sector distinguishes two basic activities: agricultural production and agricultural support activities. Agricultural production includes establishments performing the complete farm or ranch operation, such as farm owner-operators and tenant farm operators. Agricultural support activities include establishments that perform one or more activities associated with farm operation, such as soil preparation, planting, harvesting, and management, on a contract or fee basis.\\n\\nExcluded from the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector are establishments primarily engaged in agricultural research (e.g., experimental farms) and government establishments primarily engaged in administering programs for regulating and conserving land, mineral, wildlife, and forest use.

The term \\\"mining\\\" is used in the broad sense to include quarrying, well operations, beneficiating (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, and flotation), and other preparation customarily performed at the mine site, or as a part of mining activity.\\n\\nThe Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector distinguishes two basic activities: mine operation and mining support activities. Mine operation includes establishments operating mines, quarries, or oil and gas wells on their own account or for others on a contract or fee basis. Mining support activities include establishments that perform exploration (except geophysical surveying and mapping) on a contract or fee basis and/or other mining services on a contract or fee basis (except mine site preparation, construction, and transportation activities).\\n\\nEstablishments in the Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector are grouped and classified according to the natural resource mined or to be mined. Industries include establishments that develop and/or operate the mine site, extract the natural resources, beneficiate (i.e., prepare) the mineral mined, or provide mining support activities. Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use. The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, and centrifugal separation. In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis and distillation. However, some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages. The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit. While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.\\n\\nMining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location. Separate receipts will be collected for these activities whenever possible. When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, and then beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals into more finished manufactured products are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment. A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products will be classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction. An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured product will be classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing.\"}, {\"index\": 172, \"Code\": \"22\", \"Title\": \"Utilities\", \"Description\": \"Utilities: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Utilities sector comprises establishments engaged in the provision of the following utility services: electric power, natural gas, steam supply, water supply, and sewage treatment and disposal.

These establishments also collect, treat, and dispose of waste materials; however, they do not use sewer systems or sewage treatment facilities.\"}, {\"index\": 197, \"Code\": \"23\", \"Title\": \"Construction\", \"Description\": \"Construction: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Construction sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems). Establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of sites for new construction and establishments primarily engaged in subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in this sector.\\n\\nConstruction work done may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. Activities of these establishments generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites. Production responsibilities for establishments in this sector are usually specified in (1) contracts with the owners of construction projects (prime contracts) or (2) contracts with other construction establishments (subcontracts).\\n\\nEstablishments primarily engaged in contracts that include responsibility for all aspects of individual construction projects are commonly known as general contractors, but also may be known as design-builders, construction managers, turnkey contractors, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) joint-venture contractors. Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as general contractor type establishments. Establishments of the \\\"general contractor type\\\" frequently arrange construction of separate parts of their projects through subcontracts with other construction establishments.\\n\\nEstablishments primarily engaged in activities to produce a specific component (e.g., masonry, painting, and electrical work) of a construction project are commonly known as specialty trade contractors. Activities of specialty trade contractors are usually subcontracted from other construction establishments, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, the work may be done directly for the owner of the property.\\n\\nEstablishments primarily engaged in activities to construct buildings to be sold on sites that they own are known as for-sale builders, but also may be known as speculative builders or merchant builders. For-sale builders produce buildings in a manner similar to general contractors, but their production processes also include site acquisition and securing of financial backing. For-sale builders are most often associated with the construction of residential buildings. Like general contractors, they may subcontract all or part of the actual construction work on their buildings.\\n\\nThere are substantial differences in the types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by establishments in this sector. To highlight these differences and variations in the underlying production functions, this sector is divided into three subsectors.\\n\\nSubsector 236, Construction of Buildings, comprises establishments of the general contractor type and for-sale builders involved in the construction of buildings. Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, comprises establishments involved in the construction of engineering projects. Subsector 238, Specialty Trade Contractors, comprises establishments engaged in specialty trade activities generally needed in the construction of all types of buildings.\\n\\nForce account construction is construction work performed by an enterprise primarily engaged in some business other than construction for its own account, using employees of the enterprise. This activity is not included in the construction sector unless the construction work performed is the primary activity of a separate establishment of the enterprise. The installation and the ongoing repair and maintenance of telecommunications and utility networks is excluded from construction when the establishments performing the work are not independent contractors. Although a growing proportion of this work is subcontracted to independent contractors in the Construction sector, the operating units of telecommunications and utility companies performing this work are included with the telecommunications or utility activities.\"}, {\"index\": 270, \"Code\": \"31-33\", \"Title\": \"Manufacturing\", \"Description\": \"Manufacturing: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Manufacturing sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in Sector 23, Construction.\\n\\nEstablishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and material handling equipment. However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector. Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them. Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing. Selected industries in the Manufacturing sector are comprised solely of establishments that process materials for other establishments on a contract or fee basis. Beyond these dedicated contract manufacturing industries, establishments that process materials for other establishments are generally classified in the Manufacturing industry of the processed materials.\\n\\nThe materials, substances, or components transformed by manufacturing establishments are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing establishments. The materials used may be purchased directly from producers, obtained through customary trade channels, or secured without recourse to the market by transferring the product from one establishment to another, under the same ownership.\\n\\nThe new product of a manufacturing establishment may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished to become an input for an establishment engaged in further manufacturing. For example, the product of the alumina refinery is the input used in the primary production of aluminum; primary aluminum is the input to an aluminum wire drawing plant; and aluminum wire is the input for a fabricated wire product manufacturing establishment.\\n\\nThe subsectors in the Manufacturing sector generally reflect distinct production processes related to material inputs, production equipment, and employee skills. In the machinery area, where assembling is a key activity, parts and accessories for manufactured products are classified in the industry of the finished manufactured item when they are made for separate sale. For example, an attachment for a piece of metalworking machinery would be classified with metalworking machinery. However, component inputs from other manufacturing establishments are classified based on the production function of the component manufacturer. For example, electronic components are classified in Subsector 334, Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing, and stampings are classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.\\n\\nManufacturing establishments often perform one or more activities that are classified outside the Manufacturing sector of NAICS. For instance, almost all manufacturing has some captive research and development or administrative operations, such as accounting, payroll, or management. These captive services are treated the same as captive manufacturing activities. When the services are provided by separate establishments, they are classified in the NAICS sector where such services are primary, not in manufacturing. \\n\\nThe boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. The establishments in the Manufacturing sector are engaged in the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective.

They include:\\n\\n1. Logging, classified in Sector 11, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, is considered a harvesting operation;\\n2. Beneficiating ores and other minerals, classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction, is considered part of the activity of mining;\\n3. Constructing structures, assembling prefabricated buildings, and fabricating at the construction site by contractors are classified in Sector 23, Construction;\\n4. Breaking bulk and reselling in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; assembling and selling computers on a custom basis; sorting and reselling scrap; mixing and selling paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order for resale are classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, or Sector 44-45, Retail Trade; and\\n5. Publishing and the combined activity of publishing and printing, classified in Sector 51, Information, transform information into a product for which the value to the consumer lies in the information content, not in the format in which it is distributed (i.e., the book or software compact disc).\"}, {\"index\": 900, \"Code\": \"42\", \"Title\": \"Wholesale Trade\", \"Description\": \"Wholesale Trade: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Wholesale Trade sector comprises establishments engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise. The merchandise described in this sector includes the outputs of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and certain information industries, such as publishing.\\n\\nThe wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of merchandise. Wholesalers are organized to sell or arrange the purchase or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers or retailers), (b) capital or durable nonconsumer goods, and (c) raw and intermediate materials and supplies used in production.\\n\\nWholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office. These warehouses and offices are characterized by having little or no display of merchandise. In addition, neither the design nor the location of the premises is intended to solicit walk-in traffic. Wholesalers do not normally use advertising directed to the general public. Customers are generally reached initially via telephone, in-person marketing, or by specialized advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means. Follow-up orders are either vendor-initiated or client-initiated, generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties between sellers and buyers. In fact, transactions are often conducted between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing business relationships.\\n\\nThis sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers that sell goods on their own account and agents and brokers that arrange sales and purchases for others generally for a commission or fee.\\n\\n(1) Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as wholesale merchants, distributors, jobbers, drop shippers, and import/export merchants. Also included as wholesale merchants are sales offices and sales branches (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products, and group purchasing organizations primarily purchasing and selling goods on their own account. Merchant wholesale establishments typically maintain their own warehouse, where they receive and handle goods for their customers. Goods are generally sold without transformation, but may include integral functions, such as sorting, packaging, labeling, and other marketing services.\\n\\n(2) Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by others or purchasing goods, generally on a commission basis are known as business-to-business electronic markets, agents and brokers, commission merchants, import/export agents and brokers, auction companies, group purchasing organizations (acting as agents), and manufacturers' representatives. These establishments operate from offices and generally do not own or handle the goods they sell.\\n\\nSome wholesale establishments may be connected with a single manufacturer and promote and sell the particular manufacturer's products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers. Other wholesalers may be connected to a retail chain, or limited number of retail chains, and only provide a variety of products needed by that particular retail operation(s). These wholesalers may obtain the products from a wide range of manufacturers. Still other wholesalers may not take title to the goods, but act as agents and brokers for a commission.\\n\\nAlthough, in general, wholesaling normally denotes sales in large volumes, durable nonconsumer goods may be sold in single units. Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods and services, such as farm machinery, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial machinery, are always included in wholesale trade.\"}, {\"index\": 1061, \"Code\": \"44-45\", \"Title\": \"Retail Trade\", \"Description\": \"Retail Trade: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Retail Trade sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.\\n\\nThe retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public. Retail stores are fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers. In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers. Retailers often reach customers and market merchandise with methods other than, or in addition to, physical stores, such as Internet websites, the broadcasting of \\\"infomercials,\\\" the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines. Establishments engaged in the direct sale and home delivery of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes, are included here.\\n\\nRetail establishments typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but some also serve business and institutional clients. These include office supply retailers, computer and software retailers, building materials dealers, plumbing supply retailers, and electrical supply retailers.\\n\\nIn addition to retailing merchandise, some retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such as repair and installation. For example, new automobile dealers, electronics and appliance retailers, and musical instrument and supplies retailers often provide repair services. As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector.\\n\\nRetail trade establishments are grouped into industries and industry groups typically based on one or more of the following criteria:\\n\\n(a) The merchandise line or lines carried; for example, specialty retailers are distinguished from general-line retailers.\\n\\n(b) The usual trade designation of the establishments. This criterion applies in cases where a retailer is well recognized by the industry and the public, but difficult to define strictly in terms of merchandise lines carried; for example, pharmacies and department stores.\\n\\n(c) Human resource requirements in terms of expertise; for example, the staff of an automobile dealer requires knowledge in financing, registering, and licensing issues that are not necessary in other retail industries.\\n\\nThe buying of goods for resale is a characteristic of retail trade establishments that particularly distinguishes them from establishments in the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction industries. For example, farms that sell their products at or from the point of production are not classified in retail, but rather in agriculture. Similarly, establishments that both manufacture and sell their products to the general public are not classified in retail, but rather in manufacturing. However, establishments that engage in processing activities incidental to retailing are classified in retail. This includes optical goods retailers that grind lenses, and meat and seafood retailers that process carcasses into cuts.\\n\\nWholesalers also engage in the buying of goods for resale, but they are not usually organized to serve the general public. They typically operate from a warehouse or office, and neither the design nor the location of these premises is intended to solicit a high volume of walk-in traffic. Wholesalers supply institutional, industrial, wholesale, and retail clients; their operations are, therefore, generally organized to purchase, sell, and deliver merchandise in larger quantities. However, dealers of durable nonconsumer goods, such as farm machinery and heavy-duty trucks, are included in wholesale trade even if they often sell these products in single units.\"}, {\"index\": 1200, \"Code\": \"48-49\", \"Title\": \"Transportation and Warehousing\", \"Description\": \"Transportation and Warehousing: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Transportation and Warehousing sector includes industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo, warehousing and storage for goods, scenic and sightseeing transportation, and support activities related to modes of transportation. Establishments in these industries use transportation equipment or transportation-related facilities as a productive asset. The type of equipment depends on the mode of transportation. The modes of transportation are air, rail, water, road, and pipeline.\\n\\nThe Transportation and Warehousing sector distinguishes three basic types of activities: subsectors for each mode of transportation, a subsector for warehousing and storage, and a subsector for establishments providing support activities for transportation. In addition, there are subsectors for establishments that provide passenger transportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes, postal services, and courier services.\\n\\nA separate subsector for support activities is established in the sector because, first, support activities for transportation are inherently multimodal, such as freight transportation arrangement, or have multimodal aspects. Secondly, there are production process similarities among the support activity industries.\\n\\nOne of the support activities identified in the Support Activities for Transportation subsector is the routine repair and maintenance of transportation equipment (e.g., aircraft at an airport, railroad rolling stock at a railroad terminal, or ships at a harbor or port facility). Such establishments do not perform complete overhauling or rebuilding of transportation equipment (i.e., periodic restoration of transportation equipment to original design specifications) or transportation equipment conversion (i.e., major modification to systems). An establishment that primarily performs factory (or shipyard) overhauls, rebuilding, or conversions of aircraft, railroad rolling stock, or ships is classified in Subsector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing, according to the type of equipment.\\n\\nMany of the establishments in this sector often operate on networks, with physical facilities, labor forces, and equipment spread over an extensive geographic area.\\n\\nWarehousing establishments in this sector are distinguished from merchant wholesaling in that the warehouse establishments do not sell the goods.\\n\\nExcluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in providing travel agent, travel arrangement, and reservation services that support transportation establishments, hotels, other businesses, and government agencies. These establishments are classified in Sector 56, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services. Establishments primarily engaged in providing rental and leasing of transportation equipment without operator are classified in Subsector 532, Rental and Leasing Services. Establishments primarily engaged in providing medical care with transportation are classified in Sector 62, Health Care and Social Assistance.\"}, {\"index\": 1340, \"Code\": \"51\", \"Title\": \"Information\", \"Description\": \"Information: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Information sector comprises establishments engaged in the following processes: (a) producing and distributing information and cultural products, (b) providing the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as data or communications, and (c) processing data.\\n\\nThe main components of this sector are motion picture and sound recording industries; publishing industries, including software publishing; broadcasting and content providers; telecommunications industries; computing infrastructure providers, data processing, Web hosting, and related services; and Web search portals, libraries, archives, and other information services.\\n\\nThe unique characteristics of information and cultural products, and of the processes involved in their production and distribution, distinguish the Information sector from the goods-producing and service-producing sectors. Some of these characteristics are:\\n\\n1. Unlike traditional goods, an ''information or cultural product,'' such as an online newspaper or a television program, does not necessarily have tangible qualities, nor is it necessarily associated with a particular form. A movie can be viewed at a movie theater or through television broadcast, video-on-demand, or streaming services. A sound recording can be aired on radio, embedded in multimedia products, streamed, or sold at a record store.\\n\\n2. Unlike traditional services, the delivery of these products does not require direct contact between the supplier and the consumer.\\n\\n3. The value of these products to the consumer lies in their informational, educational, cultural, or entertainment content, not in the format in which they are distributed. Most of these products are protected from unlawful reproduction by copyright laws. \\n\\n4. The intangible property aspect of information and cultural products makes the processes involved in their production and distribution very different from goods and services. Only those possessing the rights to these works are authorized to reproduce, alter, improve, and distribute them. Acquiring and using these rights often involves significant costs. In addition, technology has revolutionized the distribution of these products. It is possible to distribute them in a physical form, via broadcast, or online.\\n\\n5. Distributors of information and cultural products can easily add value to the products they distribute. For instance, broadcasters add advertising not contained in the original product. This capacity means that unlike traditional goods distributors, they derive revenue not from sale of the distributed product to the final consumer, but from those who pay for the privilege of adding information to the original product. Similarly, a directory and mailing list publisher can acquire the rights to thousands of previously published newspaper and periodical articles and add new value by providing search and software and organizing the information in a way that facilitates research and retrieval. These products often command a much higher price than the original information.\\n\\nExcluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in custom design of software; mass reproducing software or other prerecorded audio and video material on magnetic or optical media; producing live artistic and cultural works or productions; and performing in or creating artistic and cultural works or productions as independent (i.e., freelance) individuals.\"}, {\"index\": 1411, \"Code\": \"52\", \"Title\": \"Finance and Insurance\", \"Description\": \"Finance and Insurance: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Finance and Insurance sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in financial transactions (transactions involving the creation, liquidation, or change in ownership of financial assets) and/or in facilitating financial transactions. Three principal types of activities are identified:\\n\\n1. Raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities. Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or purchasing securities. Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale, and risk. This activity is known as financial intermediation.\\n\\n2. Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities. Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, insurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual payments. Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment.\\n\\n3. Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee benefit programs.\\n\\nIn addition, monetary authorities charged with monetary control are included in this sector.\\n\\nThe subsectors, industry groups, and industries within the Finance and Insurance sector are defined on the basis of their unique production processes. As with all industries, the production processes are distinguished by their use of specialized human resources and specialized physical capital. In addition, the way in which these establishments acquire and allocate financial capital, their source of funds, and the use of those funds provides a third basis for distinguishing characteristics of the production process. For instance, the production process in raising funds through deposit-taking is different from the process of raising funds in bond or money markets. The process of making loans to individuals also requires different production processes than does the creation of investment pools or the underwriting of securities.\\n\\nMost of the Finance and Insurance subsectors contain one or more industry groups of (1) intermediaries with similar patterns of raising and using funds and (2) establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, that type of financial or insurance intermediation. Industries within this sector are defined in terms of activities for which a production process can be specified, and many of these activities are not exclusive to a particular type of financial institution. To deal with the varied activities taking place within existing financial institutions, the approach is to split these institutions into components performing specialized services. This requires defining the units engaged in providing those services and developing procedures that allow for their delineation. These units are the equivalents for finance and insurance of the establishments defined for other industries.\\n\\nThe output of many financial services, as well as the inputs and the processes by which they are combined, cannot be observed at a single location and can only be defined at a higher level of the organizational structure of the enterprise. Additionally, a number of independent activities that represent separate and distinct production processes may take place at a single location belonging to a multilocation financial firm. Activities are more likely to be homogeneous with respect to production characteristics than are locations, at least in financial services. The classification defines activities broadly enough that it can be used both by those classifying by location and by those employing a more top-down approach to the delineation of the establishment.\\n\\nEstablishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, the various types of intermediation are included in multiple subsectors, rather than in a separate subsector dedicated to services alone, because these services are performed by intermediaries, as well as by specialist establishments, and the extent to which the activity of the intermediaries can be separately identified is not clear.\\n\\nFinancial industries are extensive users of electronic means for facilitating the verification of financial balances, authorizing transactions, transferring funds to and from transactors' accounts, notifying banks (or credit card issuers) of the individual transactions, and providing daily summaries. Since these transaction processing activities are integral to the production of finance and insurance services, establishments that principally provide a financial transaction processing service are classified in this sector, rather than in the data processing industry in the Information sector.\\n\\nLegal entities that hold portfolios of assets on behalf of others are significant and data on them are required for a variety of purposes. Thus, for NAICS, these funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles are the fifth subsector of the Finance and Insurance sector. These entities earn interest, dividends, and other property income, but have little or no employment and no revenue from the sale of services. Separate establishments and employees devoted to the management of funds are classified in Industry Group 5239, Other Financial Investment Activities.\"}]",

However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.",

Since you're currently only considering General Liability, there are several other LOBs that would be excellent fits for this seafood processing business that you should definitely consider offering: **FINAL ANSWER: Yes, there are several other LOBs that would be excellent fits for this seafood processing business beyond General Liability:** 1. **Property Coverage** - Essential for a seafood processor with smoking equipment, refrigeration systems, and processing facilities. The business likely has significant property exposure from specialized equipment and inventory that needs protection. 2. **Workers Compensation** - Critical for a food processing operation where employees work with machinery, sharp tools, and in potentially hazardous conditions around smoking equipment and processing lines. 3. **Cyber Liability** - Important for any business that handles customer data, payment processing, and supply chain management systems. Food processors often have sophisticated inventory and distribution systems that create cyber exposure. 4. **Auto Coverage** - Likely needed if the business has delivery vehicles, refrigerated trucks, or company vehicles for transportation of products or business operations. 5. **BOP (Business Owners Policy)** - Could be a cost-effective package option that combines property and general liability coverage with additional business coverages. **The rationale is that NAICS code 311710 (Seafood Product Preparation and Packaging) shows \"Yes\" appetite across all states for all six available LOBs. This seafood processing operation has multiple risk exposures typical of food manufacturing businesses - property risks from specialized equipment, workers comp risks from processing operations, auto risks if they have delivery vehicles, and cyber risks from business systems. All National Insurance is clearly comfortable writing comprehensive coverage for this industry classification.**",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants to know which insurance products or lines are appropriate for ElasticTouch Rubber Goods based on their current operations and industry. Let me start by recalling what the previous interaction involved.\n\nElasticTouch is a company in New Jersey, manufacturing latex gloves, balloons, tubing, etc. They're part of the All Other Rubber Product Manufacturing category under NAICS 326299. The tool response provided a list of possible lines including workers compensation, property, general liability, auto, cyber, and bop. The appetite guide table also indicated \"Yes\" for all these options.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's any overlap between the industry classification and the available insurance lines. Since their primary business involves rubber manufacturing, the lines like workers compensation (for employee injuries), property (for premises), and general liability (covering products) fit well. Auto and cyber liabilities might be relevant for commercial vehicles or data security, which aligns with their operations. The BOP (if applicable) would ensure coverage for individuals who work at the facility.\n\nI should present these options clearly, ensuring that the user knows each line's relevance based on their specific industry. Also, note that some lines might require specific eligibility criteria, so it's important to mention that these are general recommendations without additional details. That way, the user can make informed decisions based on their actual needs and policies.",

The reason is that this residential property ownership and management company falls under NAICS code 531110 (Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings) since they own the properties they manage. According to All National Insurance's underwriting guidelines, for Property LOB, business classes pertaining to leasing (including NAICS code 531110) are only in appetite if the building construction is sufficiently fire resistive, meaning Type I or Type II construction.

Your company has 30 employees, which is well below the 500-employee threshold. This means the company qualifies as a small business.

The company manufactures high-end leather goods, which corresponds to NAICS code 316990 (\"Other Leather and Allied Product Manufacturing\"). This NAICS code maps to 2012 NAICS codes 316992 and 316998, for which the small business size standard is 500 employees. The company has 30 employees, which is less than 500.

The guidelines specify that we only write policies for small businesses, and any business failing this criterion is excluded.\n\nThe user also mentioned the company has 30 employees, which is significantly lower than the typical threshold for a small business. This meets the eligibility criteria. Additionally, since the NAICS code fits within the \"General Liability\" category, and there are no other exclusions, the company should be eligible.\n\nFinally, I formatted the response to clearly state that the company qualifies as a small business and matches the criteria for the \"General Liability\" line of business.

They mentioned the company operates taxi and app-based rideshare, which falls under NAICS code 4853. \n\nFirst, looking back at the underwriting guidelines, there was a $1,000 deductible for most small businesses, but for specific industries like taxi/limousines, we increase it. Also, the guidance says to consider factors like vehicle count and usage frequency when deciding on the deductible.\n\nSince the company has taxi and app-based rideshare vehicles, which are part of NAICS 4853, I should adjust the deductible accordingly. The user didn't specify the exact industry, so the best approach is to follow the guidelines that state for taxi/limousines, the deductible is $5,000. That makes sense based on the provided information and the underwriting rules. No other details were given, so sticking to the established benchmarks is the way to go.",

The assembling of component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in Sector 23, Construction.\\n\\nEstablishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and material handling equipment. However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector. Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them. Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing. Selected industries in the Manufacturing sector are comprised solely of establishments that process materials for other establishments on a contract or fee basis. Beyond these dedicated contract manufacturing industries, establishments that process materials for other establishments are generally classified in the Manufacturing industry of the processed materials.\\n\\nThe materials, substances, or components transformed by manufacturing establishments are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing establishments. The materials used may be purchased directly from producers, obtained through customary trade channels, or secured without recourse to the market by transferring the product from one establishment to another, under the same ownership.\\n\\nThe new product of a manufacturing establishment may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished to become an input for an establishment engaged in further manufacturing. For example, the product of the alumina refinery is the input used in the primary production of aluminum; primary aluminum is the input to an aluminum wire drawing plant; and aluminum wire is the input for a fabricated wire product manufacturing establishment.\\n\\nThe subsectors in the Manufacturing sector generally reflect distinct production processes related to material inputs, production equipment, and employee skills. In the machinery area, where assembling is a key activity, parts and accessories for manufactured products are classified in the industry of the finished manufactured item when they are made for separate sale. For example, an attachment for a piece of metalworking machinery would be classified with metalworking machinery. However, component inputs from other manufacturing establishments are classified based on the production function of the component manufacturer. For example, electronic components are classified in Subsector 334, Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing, and stampings are classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.\\n\\nManufacturing establishments often perform one or more activities that are classified outside the Manufacturing sector of NAICS. For instance, almost all manufacturing has some captive research and development or administrative operations, such as accounting, payroll, or management. These captive services are treated the same as captive manufacturing activities. When the services are provided by separate establishments, they are classified in the NAICS sector where such services are primary, not in manufacturing. \\n\\nThe boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. The establishments in the Manufacturing sector are engaged in the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NAICS:\\n<table width=100%><tr><td width=10%> </td><td><dl><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Milk bottling and pasteurizing;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Water bottling and processing;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Fresh fish packaging (oyster<br/> shucking, fish filleting);</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Apparel jobbing (assigning<br/> materials to contract<br/> factories or shops for<br/> fabrication or other contract<br/> operations) as well as<br/> contracting on materials<br/> owned by others;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Printing and related activities;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Ready-mix concrete production;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Leather converting;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Grinding lenses to<br/> prescription;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Wood preserving;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Lapidary work for the trade;</dt></dl></td><td width=10%> </td><td><dl><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Electroplating, plating, metal<br/> heat treating, and<br/> polishing for the trade;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Fabricating signs and<br/> advertising displays;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Rebuilding or remanufacturing<br/> machinery (i.e., automotive<br/> parts);</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Making manufactured homes<br/> (i.e., mobile homes) or<br/> prefabricated buildings,<br/> whether or not assembling/<br/> erecting at the customers'<br/> site;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Ship repair and renovation;</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Machine shops; and</dt><dt style='padding-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;'>Tire retreading.</dt></dl></td><td width=10%> </td></tr></table>\\nConversely, there are activities that are sometimes considered manufacturing, but which for NAICS are classified in another sector (i.e., not classified as manufacturing). They include:\\n\\n1. Logging, classified in Sector 11, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, is considered a harvesting operation;\\n2. Beneficiating ores and other minerals, classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction, is considered part of the activity of mining;\\n3. Constructing structures, assembling prefabricated buildings, and fabricating at the construction site by contractors are classified in Sector 23, Construction;\\n4. Breaking bulk and reselling in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; assembling and selling computers on a custom basis; sorting and reselling scrap; mixing and selling paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order for resale are classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, or Sector 44-45, Retail Trade; and\\n5. Publishing and the combined activity of publishing and printing, classified in Sector 51, Information, transform information into a product for which the value to the consumer lies in the information content, not in the format in which it is distributed (i.e., the book or software compact disc).\"}, {\"index\": 1061, \"Code\": \"44-45\", \"Title\": \"Retail Trade\", \"Description\": \"Retail Trade: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Retail Trade sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.\\n\\nThe retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public. Retail stores are fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers. In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers. Retailers often reach customers and market merchandise with methods other than, or in addition to, physical stores, such as Internet websites, the broadcasting of \\\"infomercials,\\\" the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines. Establishments engaged in the direct sale and home delivery of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes, are included here.\\n\\nRetail establishments typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but some also serve business and institutional clients. These include office supply retailers, computer and software retailers, building materials dealers, plumbing supply retailers, and electrical supply retailers.\\n\\nIn addition to retailing merchandise, some retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such as repair and installation. For example, new automobile dealers, electronics and appliance retailers, and musical instrument and supplies retailers often provide repair services. As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector.\\n\\nRetail trade establishments are grouped into industries and industry groups typically based on one or more of the following criteria:\\n\\n(a) The merchandise line or lines carried; for example, specialty retailers are distinguished from general-line retailers.\\n\\n(b) The usual trade designation of the establishments. This criterion applies in cases where a retailer is well recognized by the industry and the public, but difficult to define strictly in terms of merchandise lines carried; for example, pharmacies and department stores.\\n\\n(c) Human resource requirements in terms of expertise; for example, the staff of an automobile dealer requires knowledge in financing, registering, and licensing issues that are not necessary in other retail industries.\\n\\nThe buying of goods for resale is a characteristic of retail trade establishments that particularly distinguishes them from establishments in the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction industries. For example, farms that sell their products at or from the point of production are not classified in retail, but rather in agriculture. Similarly, establishments that both manufacture and sell their products to the general public are not classified in retail, but rather in manufacturing. However, establishments that engage in processing activities incidental to retailing are classified in retail. This includes optical goods retailers that grind lenses, and meat and seafood retailers that process carcasses into cuts.\\n\\nWholesalers also engage in the buying of goods for resale, but they are not usually organized to serve the general public. They typically operate from a warehouse or office, and neither the design nor the location of these premises is intended to solicit a high volume of walk-in traffic. Wholesalers supply institutional, industrial, wholesale, and retail clients; their operations are, therefore, generally organized to purchase, sell, and deliver merchandise in larger quantities. However, dealers of durable nonconsumer goods, such as farm machinery and heavy-duty trucks, are included in wholesale trade even if they often sell these products in single units.\"}, {\"index\": 1340, \"Code\": \"51\", \"Title\": \"Information\", \"Description\": \"Information: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Information sector comprises establishments engaged in the following processes: (a) producing and distributing information and cultural products, (b) providing the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as data or communications, and (c) processing data.\\n\\nThe main components of this sector are motion picture and sound recording industries; publishing industries, including software publishing; broadcasting and content providers; telecommunications industries; computing infrastructure providers, data processing, Web hosting, and related services; and Web search portals, libraries, archives, and other information services.\\n\\nThe unique characteristics of information and cultural products, and of the processes involved in their production and distribution, distinguish the Information sector from the goods-producing and service-producing sectors. Some of these characteristics are:\\n\\n1. Unlike traditional goods, an ''information or cultural product,'' such as an online newspaper or a television program, does not necessarily have tangible qualities, nor is it necessarily associated with a particular form. A movie can be viewed at a movie theater or through television broadcast, video-on-demand, or streaming services. A sound recording can be aired on radio, embedded in multimedia products, streamed, or sold at a record store.\\n\\n2. Unlike traditional services, the delivery of these products does not require direct contact between the supplier and the consumer.\\n\\n3. The value of these products to the consumer lies in their informational, educational, cultural, or entertainment content, not in the format in which they are distributed. Most of these products are protected from unlawful reproduction by copyright laws. \\n\\n4. The intangible property aspect of information and cultural products makes the processes involved in their production and distribution very different from goods and services. Only those possessing the rights to these works are authorized to reproduce, alter, improve, and distribute them. Acquiring and using these rights often involves significant costs. In addition, technology has revolutionized the distribution of these products. It is possible to distribute them in a physical form, via broadcast, or online.\\n\\n5. Distributors of information and cultural products can easily add value to the products they distribute. For instance, broadcasters add advertising not contained in the original product. This capacity means that unlike traditional goods distributors, they derive revenue not from sale of the distributed product to the final consumer, but from those who pay for the privilege of adding information to the original product. Similarly, a directory and mailing list publisher can acquire the rights to thousands of previously published newspaper and periodical articles and add new value by providing search and software and organizing the information in a way that facilitates research and retrieval. These products often command a much higher price than the original information.\\n\\nExcluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in custom design of software; mass reproducing software or other prerecorded audio and video material on magnetic or optical media; producing live artistic and cultural works or productions; and performing in or creating artistic and cultural works or productions as independent (i.e., freelance) individuals.\"}, {\"index\": 1862, \"Code\": \"71\", \"Title\": \"Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation\", \"Description\": \"Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation: The Sector as a Whole\\n\\nThe Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sector includes a wide range of establishments that operate facilities or provide services to meet varied cultural, entertainment, and recreational interests of their patrons.

According to our small business definition, software publishers (NAICS 511210/513210) must have annual revenue of $38.5 million or less to be considered a small business. While this business meets that threshold, our general underwriting guidelines state that \"We write policies for small businesses only.\" Since this business qualifies as a small business and is in the Information sector (NAICS code 51) which shows \"Qualified\" appetite for cyber LOB, it would normally be in appetite. However, I note that the underwriting guidelines specifically mention that for cyber liability insurance, NAICS code 51 (Information) businesses should have much higher limits of $3 million per-occurrence and $5 million aggregate, rather than the standard $1 million/$2 million limits. So while the business itself is in appetite, special consideration should be given to the recommended policy limits for cyber coverage. Wait, I need to reconsider - let me check this more carefully. The business IS a small business (revenue of $4.1M is well below the $38.5M threshold), and the appetite guide shows \"Qualified\" for cyber LOB for Information sector businesses. The guidelines don't say we decline Information sector businesses for cyber - they just recommend higher limits. FINAL ANSWER: IN APPETITE. The reason is because this accounting software business is classified under NAICS code 513210 (Software Publishers), which falls under the Information sector (NAICS 51).

Any business that fails to qualify as a \"small business\" is out of appetite, so we will not write a policy for it. ***Property LOB*** For property LOB, business classes pertaining to hospitality or leasing are only in appetite if the building construction is sufficiently fire resistive. This means the building construction codes are either Type I or Type II. Specifically, this is relevant to the following NAICS codes using the 2022 schema: 531110 Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings 531120 Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings 531130 Lessors of Miniwarehouses and Self-Storage Units 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property 721110 Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels 721120 Casino Hotels 721191 Bed-and-Breakfast Inns ***Policy Limits*** For most small business policies we recommend a per-occurence limit of $1 million and an aggregate limit of $2 million. However, for cyber liability insurance coverage: Industry, business type, amount, and type of customer data handled determine how much cyber insurance businesses need. Specifically we recommend much higher limits of $3 million per-occurence and $5 million aggregate for cyber LOB for the following NAICS classes: NAICS code 517: Telecommunications NAICS code 518: Computing Infrastructure Providers, Data Processing, Web Hosting, and Related Services NAICS code 52: Finance and Insurance NAICS code 621: Ambulatory Health Care Services NAICS code 622310: Specialty Hospitals NAICS code 623: Nursing and Residential Care Facilities NAICS code 92: Public Administration ***Policy Deductibles*** For most small business policies we recommend a deductible of $500 across LOBs. However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.",

The size standard for NAICS 532283 (which maps to 2012 NAICS 532291) is $32.5 million in annual revenue. Your customer's revenue of $27.8 million is below this threshold. 3. **General Underwriting Guidelines**: Since your customer qualifies as a small business and the Auto LOB shows \"Yes\" for appetite (not \"Qualified\"), there are no additional restrictions that would put them out of appetite. Therefore, All National Insurance can write an Auto policy for this customer.",

This means the building construction codes are either Type I or Type II. Specifically, this is relevant to the following NAICS codes using the 2022 schema: 531110 Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings 531120 Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings 531130 Lessors of Miniwarehouses and Self-Storage Units 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property 721110 Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels 721120 Casino Hotels 721191 Bed-and-Breakfast Inns ***Policy Limits*** For most small business policies we recommend a per-occurence limit of $1 million and an aggregate limit of $2 million. However, for cyber liability insurance coverage: Industry, business type, amount, and type of customer data handled determine how much cyber insurance businesses need. Specifically we recommend much higher limits of $3 million per-occurence and $5 million aggregate for cyber LOB for the following NAICS classes: NAICS code 517: Telecommunications NAICS code 518: Computing Infrastructure Providers, Data Processing, Web Hosting, and Related Services NAICS code 52: Finance and Insurance NAICS code 621: Ambulatory Health Care Services NAICS code 622310: Specialty Hospitals NAICS code 623: Nursing and Residential Care Facilities NAICS code 92: Public Administration ***Policy Deductibles*** For most small business policies we recommend a deductible of $500 across LOBs. However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.",

Any business that fails to qualify as a \"small business\" is out of appetite, so we will not write a policy for it. ***Property LOB*** For property LOB, business classes pertaining to hospitality or leasing are only in appetite if the building construction is sufficiently fire resistive. This means the building construction codes are either Type I or Type II. Specifically, this is relevant to the following NAICS codes using the 2022 schema: 531110 Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings 531120 Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings 531130 Lessors of Miniwarehouses and Self-Storage Units 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property 721110 Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels 721120 Casino Hotels 721191 Bed-and-Breakfast Inns ***Policy Limits*** For most small business policies we recommend a per-occurence limit of $1 million and an aggregate limit of $2 million. However, for cyber liability insurance coverage: Industry, business type, amount, and type of customer data handled determine how much cyber insurance businesses need. Specifically we recommend much higher limits of $3 million per-occurence and $5 million aggregate for cyber LOB for the following NAICS classes: NAICS code 517: Telecommunications NAICS code 518: Computing Infrastructure Providers, Data Processing, Web Hosting, and Related Services NAICS code 52: Finance and Insurance NAICS code 621: Ambulatory Health Care Services NAICS code 622310: Specialty Hospitals NAICS code 623: Nursing and Residential Care Facilities NAICS code 92: Public Administration ***Policy Deductibles*** For most small business policies we recommend a deductible of $500 across LOBs. However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.",

Specifically, this is relevant to the following NAICS codes using the 2022 schema: 531110 Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings 531120 Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings 531130 Lessors of Miniwarehouses and Self-Storage Units 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property 721110 Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels 721120 Casino Hotels 721191 Bed-and-Breakfast Inns ***Policy Limits*** For most small business policies we recommend a per-occurence limit of $1 million and an aggregate limit of $2 million.

The company operates in Minnesota and the line of business is workers' compensation. 3. The `appetite_guide` does not have a specific entry for NAICS code 337110 or the broader 2-digit NAICS code 33 in Minnesota for workers' compensation. 4. According to the general underwriting guidelines, All National Insurance only writes policies for small businesses. 5. For NAICS code 337110, a business is defined as small if it has 500 or fewer employees. 6. The company has 43 employees, which is less than the 500-employee limit. Therefore, it qualifies as a small business. 7. Since the company is a small business and there are no specific exclusions for this NAICS code, state, and LOB combination in the appetite guide, it is considered in appetite. The worker's compensation guideline regarding payroll only applies if the appetite guide indicates \"qualified\", which it does not in this instance. The primary determining factor here is its status as a small business.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the analysis step by step. The user wants to know if MapleWood Cabinetry would be in appetite for writing a policy for their product, which is custom kitchen cabinets and countertops. \n\nFirst, I need to check the company's NAICS code. From the provided tools, there's a list of possible codes. After analyzing the description, I identified the correct NAICS code as 337110, which corresponds to \"Wood Kitchen Cabinet and Countertop Manufacturing.\" This aligns well with the company's stated line of business.\n\nNext, verifying the state where the company operates, it's Minnesota. The guidelines also mention that all national insurance companies write policies only for small businesses. A small business is typically defined as one with a certain employee count. The company has 43 employees, which is below the 500-employee threshold set by the appetite guide. This satisfies the small business requirement.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentioned the company's annual revenue is $5,200,000, which places them in the premium category. But since the main criterion is the size (employees), and the company meets that, the answer hinges on the employee count.\n\nFinally, checking the other guidelines, there's no explicit exclusion for this NAICS code in Minnesota or any other part of the appetite guide. Therefore, all factors point to the company being in appetite for writing a policy for their product.",

The reason is because this company operates in snack food manufacturing and distribution, which falls under NAICS Code 311919 \"Other Snack Food Manufacturing\". For this industry, the small business size standard is based on the number of employees (500 employees or fewer), not revenue. However, since the company has an annual revenue of $450,000,000 (450 million dollars), this indicates it is a very large operation that would almost certainly exceed the 500-employee threshold that defines a small business in this industry. Therefore, this company does not qualify as a small business.**",
