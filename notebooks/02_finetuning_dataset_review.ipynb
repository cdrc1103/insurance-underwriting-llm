This company's annual revenue is $64 million, which exceeds that limit. Therefore, the previously listed insurance products (Workers Compensation, Property, General Liability, Auto, Cyber, and BOP) which are generally in appetite for small businesses in this NAICS code, may not all be suitable or the terms may differ for a larger business. We would need to consult the large business underwriting guidelines for a more accurate list of suitable products.\n",

      "***General*** We write policies for small businesses only. Any business that fails to qualify as a \"small business\" is out of appetite, so we will not write a policy for it. ***Property LOB*** For property LOB, business classes pertaining to hospitality or leasing are only in appetite if the building construction is sufficiently fire resistive. This means the building construction codes are either Type I or Type II. Specifically, this is relevant to the following NAICS codes using the 2022 schema: 531110 Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings 531120 Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings 531130 Lessors of Miniwarehouses and Self-Storage Units 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property 721110 Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels 721120 Casino Hotels 721191 Bed-and-Breakfast Inns ***Policy Limits*** For most small business policies we recommend a per-occurence limit of $1 million and an aggregate limit of $2 million. However, for cyber liability insurance coverage: Industry, business type, amount, and type of customer data handled determine how much cyber insurance businesses need. Specifically we recommend much higher limits of $3 million per-occurence and $5 million aggregate for cyber LOB for the following NAICS classes: NAICS code 517: Telecommunications NAICS code 518: Computing Infrastructure Providers, Data Processing, Web Hosting, and Related Services NAICS code 52: Finance and Insurance NAICS code 621: Ambulatory Health Care Services NAICS code 622310: Specialty Hospitals NAICS code 623: Nursing and Residential Care Facilities NAICS code 92: Public Administration ***Policy Deductibles*** For most small business policies we recommend a deductible of $500 across LOBs. However, for auto insurance we generally recommend a $1000 deductible, and for the following NAICS codes we recommend a $5000 deductible: NAICS code 484: Freight Trucking NAICS code 4853: Taxi and Limousine Services NAICS code 4854: School and Employee Bus Transportation NAICS code 4855: Charter Bus Services NAICS code 4871: Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation (Land) ***Auto LOB*** If our appetite guide for an auto policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has over 20 vehicles, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high. ***Worker's Compensation LOB*** If our appetite guide for a worker's compensation policy indicates \"qualified\", then we determine final appetite according to whether the applicant has a total annual payroll of over $5M, in which case we decline because the exposure is too high.\n",

      "FINAL ANSWER: Suitable additional insurance products (lines of business) for a small, two-year college that grants associate degrees and certificates typically include: • General Liability – protects against third-party bodily injury or property-damage claims arising out of campus operations. • Property – covers buildings, contents, equipment, and business-income/extra-expense exposures such as a fire on campus. • Educators Professional Liability (Errors & Omissions) – protects against claims alleging improper academic advice, grading disputes, failure to educate, or discrimination. • Workers’ Compensation – required in most states for faculty, staff, and student workers; covers on-the-job injuries. • Cyber Liability – colleges collect and store sizable student PII and payment data; coverage would address data-breach costs, extortion, and network-interruption losses. • Commercial Auto – if the college owns vans, maintenance trucks, or shuttle buses; covers liability and physical damage. • Employment Practices Liability – addresses wrongful-termination, discrimination, or harassment allegations brought by employees or job applicants. • Umbrella/Excess – provides higher limits above underlying GL, Auto, and Employers Liability, helpful for premises-liability or athletic-injury suits. Rationale: Two-year colleges face premises-liability exposures from students and visitors, own instructional equipment and buildings that must be insured for property perils, employ faculty and staff who need workers’ compensation, handle sensitive student data (necessitating cyber), and have unique professional exposures related to educational services. An umbrella gives extra limits once primary policies exhaust. All of these fit standard small-business products All National writes and, absent any disqualifying size or construction factors, are generally in appetite.\n",
